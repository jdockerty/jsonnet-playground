# jsonnet-playground

Inspired by the [Go playground](https://go.dev/play/) and others.

This project is built with Go and [htmx][htmx].

It is available at [jsonnet.jdocklabs.co.uk][hosted-playground] for broader use.
Keep in mind that snippets are ephemeral and may expire at anytime, this is because
storage is entirely in-memory for cloud billing purposes.
